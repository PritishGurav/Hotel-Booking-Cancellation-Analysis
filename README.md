<h2>📖 Story Behind the Project</h2>

<p>
Every journey begins with curiosity — mine started when I discovered an interesting dataset about <b>hotel bookings</b>.  
At first, it looked like simple information: dates, locations, rooms, and prices.  
But as I explored deeper, I noticed something surprising — a <b>significant number of guests canceled their bookings</b>.
</p>

<p>
That question pushed me further:  
<i>“Why are so many people canceling? Is it the price? The timing? Or something else?”</i>  
</p>

<p>
Guided by the <b>WsCube Tech YouTube channel</b>, I decided to dive into this mystery.  
Using <b>Python</b> and <b>Jupyter Notebook</b>, I started cleaning, visualizing, and analyzing the data — trying to uncover the deeper story behind these cancellations.

<h2>🎯 Objectives of the Journey</h2>

<p>
The goal was not just to identify numbers, but to understand the human behavior behind them — what makes a guest cancel a stay?
</p>

<ul>
  <li>📉 <b>Understand why cancellations happen</b> and the major factors behind them.</li>
  <li>🔍 <b>Study guest patterns</b> — timing, preferences, and room types.</li>
  <li>💡 <b>Suggest practical ideas</b> to help hotels reduce cancellations and improve retention.</li>
</ul>

<h2>📊 Insights From the Data</h2>

<p>
As the analysis unfolded, patterns emerged — and each one told its own story.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>📅 Guests who booked <b>far in advance</b> were more likely to cancel.</li>
  <li>💰 <b>Higher room prices</b> and <b>peak seasons</b> brought more cancellations.</li>
  <li>🔁 Guests who had stayed before rarely canceled — trust matters!</li>
  <li>🌍 Most cancellations came from <b>online travel agents</b>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
These weren’t just numbers — they represented expectations, budgets, loyalty, and convenience.
</p>

<h2>💬 My Recommendations</h2>

<p>
After understanding the patterns, I explored opportunities to help hotels minimize cancellations.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>⚙️ Use <b>dynamic pricing</b> during busy seasons to stay competitive.</li>
  <li>🎁 Introduce <b>loyalty programs</b> to promote repeat stays.</li>
  <li>🔮 Build <b>prediction models</b> to identify high-risk cancellations early.</li>
  <li>📢 Strengthen <b>direct booking incentives</b> to reduce dependency on OTAs.</li>
</ul>
